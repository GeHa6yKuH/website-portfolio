# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site is a reflection of my personality and skills, showcasing what I can create using the React framework. Although I'm not primarily a front-end developer, I built this site to demonstrate my ability to learn and implement new technologies.

This project was inspired by [this portfolio](https://bobangajicsm.github.io/portfolio/contact.html), but I have added my own styles and logic to make it uniquely mine.

Feel free to explore and learn more about me and my work!
